# Portfolio

## Description

Hello! Welcome to my Portfolio Project. I created this page to showcase some of the coding languages I've learned in just one week. I have used both HTML and CSS to create the page. The page will showcase some of my previous work as well as take you directly to my project's page and the GitHub page for that project. The formatting of the page's sections via CSS was a nice challenge to overcome.

## Usage

<img src="C:\Users\jacob\OneDrive\desktop\homework\Portfolio\assets\images\Screenshot-Portfolio.png">
The page I have created allows you to get into contact with me if you are interested in a professional collaboration. 
Check it out!
